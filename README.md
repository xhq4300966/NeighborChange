# NeighborChange
NeighborChange is a project dedicated to connecting neighbors with material or labor exchanges.

Rapid urbanization and demographic changes in cities and rural areas, unfortunately, have made it increasingly difficult to build a robust, mutually-supportive community. Meanwhile, climate change, economic recessions, and outbreaks have caught us unguarded; those large-scale challenges seem to take not an individual but a community's effort to unite and combat against.

I hope to bring my neighbors and me together with labor and material exchanges: a ripe tomato that you would not use, a brand-new kindle that sat around for months... Ideally, the project not only brings the people closer together, but also cultivate a sense of appreciation for both things and people among our lovely neighborhood community.
